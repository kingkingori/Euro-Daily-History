It wasn't until 1999 that the euro really began its journey, 
when 11 countries (Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain) 
fixed their exchange rates and created a new currency with monetary policy passed to the European Central Bank. 
Today euro is 20+ years old.
